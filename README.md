# Getting Started with Create React App
The title of my React App is a Blog Application
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Blog website
My application will be a blog application where authors can be able to add new blogs create update and delete if a blog doesnt seem to be reasonable.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

### PROJECT TITLE
BLOG APPLICATION SITE

#### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The blogging project is a client-server Web application built over an RDBMS.  Blogging, short for web logging, is an application that runs on a portal site, in which different users (and user groups) can publish and revise daily journal entries, and these entries will be made public for others to view.  In essence, it gives everyone his or her own personal editorial column to publish to the world. The blogging system has the following features:
A client for creating and updating blog entries.  The client can be written in a number of different ways, ranging from a Java applet that runs in the web browser, to a PHP interface, to a custom Java or C# client that runs on the client side.  The client should publish blogs using an XML-based protocol such as Ruby, This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

A portal site with a database backend.  This portal site should present a main page from which peopleâ€™s blogs can be accessed; it should show the most recently updated blogs; and it should provide a means of browsing different blogs.


A good schema design that is appropriate for the data being stored.  Some of this data is simple and highly regular.
